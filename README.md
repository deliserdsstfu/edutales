# EduTales 

SWENGS Project. With our website we want to arouse the interest of children in history by connecting fairy tales with historical stories and presenting them in a playful way. The navigation is done by a simple world map. The country in which the user is located is determined. Then it is suggested whether, and the user can visit the determined country or another. It is intended to provice an interesting overview of activities and their history. The user can find out more and more historical background by browsing through different stations. In addition, sagas or fairy tales on the respective topic can be listed to teach the childrenn more about the history inn this topic. Through small tasks at the end of each station, children can collect rewards and export their results as a certificate at the end. In order to offer a varied experience some parts of the website can be easily changed.

German is used as the language for the content, so the target group are initially only children who speak or can read German. Translations into other languages are not planned in the project as this goes beyond the scope of the project.
